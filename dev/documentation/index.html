    <h4>Take Note:</h4>
    <p>We take great care to write great, useable documentation. So it might still be incomplete in places. <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute">Why don't you help out?</a></p>

<h3>A note on best practises</h3>

<p>Although Konstruct is developed to be as unobtrusive and simple as possible, there are a few code practises &amp; patterns included. These are things we use daily, and I felt it was a good enough way to do things for core. Of course you are welcome to change that, and even make a pull request to get your way in.</p>
