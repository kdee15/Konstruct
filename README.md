Konstruct Documentation
=============

This <code>GH-PAGES</code> branch serves as the official documentation site for the [Konstruct](http://traaidmark.github.io/Konstruct/) project. I try to make this as complete and up to date as possible, and each major release should have matching docs to go with it!

The content belongs to the project, but you are welcome to use the code for whatever you want. A link back and a virtual *highfive* would be nice though.
