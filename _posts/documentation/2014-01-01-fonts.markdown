This is the file where you can set up all of your typographical needs. You can import fonts, set up their variables and set default sizes, line-heights and general spacing.

### Importing Fonts

It's common to include your hosted fonts through javascript, but if you prefer not to, or can't, you can add the CSS import in the <code>// A. FONTS</code> section.

We have included 2 fonts for you.

### Font Variables

We include some common font stacks, including the above mentioned 2. You can simply set a variable for your favorite stack, and reuse as you wish! Here is an example of a font stack variable in use:

```css
// the variable:
$helvetica: 	"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

// the usage:
h1 {
    font-family: $helvetica;
}
```

### Base Setup

Here we set up the base sizes we will base all our work on.

```css
    // Change your default font type.
    $base-font:			$lato;
    
    // Choose your base font size. I like 16px and Relative Readability.
    $base-size: 		16px;
    
    // Choose your Line Height. This is also used for margins, padding and other spacing related elements. It's a great way to get consistency in your spacing system.
    $baseline: 			24px;
```

### Font Sizes

The font sizes Konstruct sets in the typography.scss file are set here. The sizes are in *em* and is relative to <code>$base-size</code>.

```css
    $x-large:			2em; 		// 32px
    $large:				1.5em; 		// 24px
    $medium:			1.125em; 	// 18px
    $normal:			1em; 		// 16px
    $small:				0.75em; 	// 12px
    $x-small:			0.625em; 	// 10px
```
