Lists are such an integral part of building a front end, that we decided to include this into Konstruct's core. You don't *have* to use it, but we suggest you do. 

A few of Konstruct's bricks use this implementation of lists.

### The HTML

``` html
<ul class="my-list">
    <li>My List Item</li>
    <li>My List Item</li>
    <li>My List Item</li>
</ul>
```

We have taken the <code>@extend</code> feature of SASS to heart, and base all of our work on that as much as possible. See General > SASS for more information.

#### Horizontal List

``` css
.my-list {
    @extend .horizontal;
    @extend .list;
}
```
**Note:** You can use normal <code>text-align:</code> to position this list horizontally.

#### Vertical List

``` css
.my-list {
    @extend .vertical;
    @extend .list;
}
```
