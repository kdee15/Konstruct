	<h1>Get started with Konstruct!</h1>
	
	<p class="lead">We highly reccommend that you get started with the Konstruct Boilerplate, which is a great platform to start your project form. Out of the box, the boilerplate hooks you up with Bower for component management, Gulp for task management and an awesome starter kit so you can begin writing your awesome site / app / rocket in seconds!</p>

    <aside class="message info">
        <h4>Before you begin:</h4>
        <p>The boilerplate assumes that you have <a href="http://http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Nodejs</a> &amp; <a href="http://bower.io" target="_blank">Bower</a> already installed. If you don't please go get that done first!</p>

	<h3>1. Get the Konstruct Boilerplate.</h3>
	
    <p>The simplest way to get hold of the boilerplate is to clone the project from Github:</p>
    
    <p><code>git clone https://github.com/traaidmark/konstruct-boilerplate.git [YOUR_FOLDER]</code></p>
    
    <h3>2. Install Gulpjs.</h3>
	
    <p>Next we need to get GulpJS up and running. If you have NodeJS &amp; Gulp installed, this should be as simple as running:</p>
    
    <p><code>npm install</code></p>
    
    <h3>3. Initiate your new site.</h3>
    
	<p>The Konstruct Boilerplate relies on Gulp to do all of the site related tasks, and this includes the Bower components. You are welcome to run the bower commands yourself, but we prefer if you follow the method below:</p>
    
    <p><code>gulp init</code></p>
    
    <small>This command will run <code>bower install</code>, and move the Konstruct library to a useable directory, and then do a clean sweep, to remove the .git folder and other small errant files. This will leave you with a clean site setup to start working with!</small>
    
    <h3>5. Go Build Something Awesome!</h3>
    
    <p>You are ready to start building!</p>
