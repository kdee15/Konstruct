The quality of documentation is pretty much directly proportionate to the success of a project. Okay, it's not, but it should be. Konstruct was always planned around it's documentation, though in practise it's been lacking somewhat. No more. We fixed that.

Today is the day that documentation goes live, and stays live for as long as the project stays online. Yay! Sort of. There is a still a mountain of work ahead of us, but we are slowly getting it done. In the coming weeks you will see this site improve exponentially.

We are keeping this website basic for the moment, but we will start adding cool things to it in future releases. We find it's so much more important to focus on a good quality product, with equal quality documentation than it is to have cool features!
