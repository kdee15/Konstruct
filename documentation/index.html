<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<p class="lead">Welcome to the Konstruct documentation. This is where you will pick up all you need to know to get Konstruct up and running quickly.</p>

<h3>What is Konstruct?</h3>

<p>Although Konstruct is developed to be as unobtrusive and simple as possible, there are a few code practises &amp; patterns included. These are things we use daily, and I felt it was a good enough way to do things for core. Of course you are welcome to change that, and even make a pull request to get your way in.</p>
