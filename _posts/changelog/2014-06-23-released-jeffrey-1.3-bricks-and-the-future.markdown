While 1.2 saw the first real production release of Konstruct, 1.3 is similarly significant in it's own regard. It marks the start of a plan, a goal and a direction for the project to live in. 

1.3, codenamed Jeffrey answers several fundamental questions we had regarding what Konstruct wants to be, and where we hope to take it.

### Striving towards simplicity

Nobody likes being told what to do, or how to do something. 

### Keeping it modular
