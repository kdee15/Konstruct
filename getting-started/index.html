	<h1>Get started with Konstruct!</h1>
	
	<p class="lead">We recommend getting up and running with the Konstruct boilerplate, a separate project that comes with a few extra goodies to help you manage your project a bit better.</p>
    
    <p>Out of the box, Konstruct is just a <em>SASS</em> library, but with the boilerplate you get all of the extra benefits from tools such as:</p>

    <aside class="message info">
        <h4>Before you begin:</h4>
        <p>The boilerplate assumes that you have Nodejs, Sass, Gulpjs &amp; Bower installed. If you don't, or don't know what these are, please go walk through this article, that should point you in the right direction.</p>

	<h3>1. Get the Konstruct Boilerplate.</h3>
	
    <p>The simplest way to get hold of the boilerplate is to clone the project from Github:</p>
    
    <p><code>git clone https://github.com/traaidmark/konstruct-boilerplate.git [YOUR_FOLDER]</code></p>
    
    <h3>2. Install Gulpjs.</h3>
	
    <p>Next we need to get GulpJS up and running. If you have NodeJS &amp; Gulp installed, this should be as simple as running:</p>
    
    <p><code>npm install</code></p>
    
    <h3>3. Initiate your new site.</h3>
    
	<p>The Konstruct Boilerplate relies on Gulp to do all of the site related tasks, and this includes the Bower components. You are welcome to run the bower commands yourself, but we prefer if you follow the method below:</p>
    
    <p><code>gulp init</code></p>
    
    <small>This command will run <code>bower install</code>, and move the Konstruct library to a useable directory, and then do a clean sweep, to remove the .git folder and other small errant files. This will leave you with a clean site setup to start working with!</small>
    
    <h3>5. Go Build Something Awesome!</h3>
    
    <p>You are ready to start building!</p>
    
    <p>Be sure to check out the Konstruct Gulp Documentation for a list of all the available commands and their usage.</p>
